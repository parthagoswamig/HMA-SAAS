# Patient Module - Schedule Appointment & Documents Fix

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Schedule Appointment Not Working** ✅
**Problem**: Clicking "Schedule Appointment" only logged to console, didn't navigate anywhere.

**Solution**: 
- Now closes the patient details modal
- Navigates to `/dashboard/appointments` page with patient ID as query parameter
- Appointments page can pre-select the patient

**Code Change** (`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/patients/page.tsx` lines 753-759):
```typescript
const handleScheduleAppointment = (patientId: string) => {
  console.log('Schedule appointment for patient:', patientId);
  // Close the patient details modal
  closeView();
  // Navigate to appointments page with patient pre-selected
  window.location.href = `/dashboard/appointments?patientId=${patientId}`;
};
```

### **2. Documents Showing 0 After Upload** ✅
**Problem**: 
- Documents were uploaded successfully
- But when viewing patient details, it showed "Documents (0)"
- Documents were lost when switching between patients

**Root Cause**: 
- Documents were stored in a single `patientDocuments` state
- When viewing a different patient, documents were reset to empty array
- No persistence per patient

**Solution**:
- Added `documentsMap` state to store documents per patient ID
- When uploading: Save to both current state AND the map
- When viewing patient: Load documents from the map for that patient ID
- Documents now persist across patient switches

**Code Changes**:

**Added state** (line 78):
```typescript
const [documentsMap, setDocumentsMap] = useState<Record<string, any[]>>({});
```

**Load documents when viewing** (lines 319-320):
```typescript
setSelectedPatient(fullPatient);
setPatientDocuments(documentsMap[fullPatient.id] || []);
openView();
```

**Save documents to map on upload** (lines 520-525):
```typescript
const updatedDocs = [...(documentsMap[selectedPatient.id] || []), newDocument];
setPatientDocuments(updatedDocs);
setDocumentsMap(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  [selectedPatient.id]: updatedDocs
}));
```

**Update/Delete also update the map** (similar pattern for both operations)

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Schedule Appointment Flow**:
```
1. User views patient details
2. Clicks "Schedule Appointment"
3. Modal closes
4. Navigates to /dashboard/appointments?patientId=xxx
5. Appointments page can use the patientId to pre-fill the form
```

### **Document Persistence Flow**:
```
1. User uploads document for Patient A
   → Saved to documentsMap['patient-a-id'] = [doc1]
   
2. User switches to Patient B
   → Loads documentsMap['patient-b-id'] || []
   
3. User uploads document for Patient B
   → Saved to documentsMap['patient-b-id'] = [doc2]
   
4. User switches back to Patient A
   → Loads documentsMap['patient-a-id'] = [doc1] ✅
   → Documents are preserved!
```

## ✅ **Testing**

### **Test Schedule Appointment**:
1. Open any patient details
2. Click "Schedule Appointment" button
3. Should navigate to appointments page with patient ID in URL

### **Test Document Persistence**:
1. Open Patient A details
2. Go to Documents tab
3. Upload a document (e.g., "test.pdf")
4. Close modal
5. Open Patient B details
6. Upload a different document
7. Close modal
8. Open Patient A details again
9. Go to Documents tab
10. **Expected**: Should show "Documents (1)" and display the uploaded file ✅

## 📝 **Files Modified**

1. `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/patients/page.tsx`
   - Added `documentsMap` state
   - Updated `handleScheduleAppointment` to navigate
   - Updated `handleViewPatient` to load documents
   - Updated `handleOpenDocuments` to load documents
   - Updated `handleUploadDocument` to save to map
   - Updated `handleUpdateDocument` to update map
   - Updated `handleDeleteDocument` to update map
   - Updated PatientDetails component to pass `patientDocuments` instead of empty array

## 🚀 **Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)**

### **For Production**:
1. **Persist documents to database**:
   - Create backend API endpoint for document upload
   - Store files in cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
   - Save document metadata to database
   
2. **Fetch documents from API**:
   - When viewing patient, fetch their documents from backend
   - Replace `documentsMap` with API calls

3. **Appointments page integration**:
   - Update appointments page to read `patientId` from URL
   - Pre-fill patient selection in appointment form

---

## 🎉 **Summary**

- ✅ Schedule Appointment now navigates to appointments page
- ✅ Documents persist per patient (in memory)
- ✅ Document count displays correctly in tabs
- ✅ No data loss when switching between patients
- ✅ All CRUD operations (upload, update, delete) work correctly

**Both issues are now resolved!** 🎊
