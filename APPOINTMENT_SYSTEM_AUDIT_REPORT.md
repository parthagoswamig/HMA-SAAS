## Critical Error Fixed

### ❌ **CRITICAL: DateTimePicker Type Mismatch**
**Location:** `apps/web/src/app/dashboard/appointments/page.tsx:421-423, 1430`

**Problem:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN - TYPE ERROR)
const handleDateTimeChange = (value: string) => {
  setFormData({ ...formData, appointmentDateTime: value });
};

<DateTimePicker
  value={formData.appointmentDateTime}  // ❌ String passed, Date expected
  onChange={handleDateTimeChange}
/>
```

**Impact:**
- DateTimePicker component expects `Date | null` but received `string`
- Form would not work correctly
- Date selection would fail
- TypeScript type error
- User unable to select appointment date/time

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED - CORRECT TYPES)
const handleDateTimeChange = (value: Date | null) => {
  setFormData({ ...formData, appointmentDateTime: value ? value.toISOString() : '' });
};

<DateTimePicker
  value={formData.appointmentDateTime ? new Date(formData.appointmentDateTime) : null}
  onChange={handleDateTimeChange}
/>
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
